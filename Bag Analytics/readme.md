# Objective
&nbsp; The objective of this project is to allow bag tracking analytics to be found in a timely manner so that it can be used to inform management decisions. Currently, most of the time spent by the analytics team is on collecting bag analytics from different sources, thus leaving less time for the team to conduct true analysis based on collected data.

# Project Goals
&nbsp; Some of the main goals within this project are to minimize the time and effort put in by the analytics team to gather bag journey data, provide deeper anaylsis of data beyond just reports, and establish a process of data storage and collection which prioritizes company needs.
