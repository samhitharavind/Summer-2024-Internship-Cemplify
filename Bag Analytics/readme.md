# Objective
&nbsp; The objective of this project is to allow bag tracking analytics to be found in a timely manner so that it can be used to inform management decisions. Currently, most of the time spent by the analytics team is on collecting bag analytics from different sources, thus leaving less time for the team to conduct true analysis based on collected data.

# Project Goals
&nbsp; Some of the main goals within this project are to have all of the bag analytics data stored in a common data vault from which it can be accessed at any given time, reduce the time spent by analysts searching for data, and maximize the amount of time spent by analysts actually observing and learning information from the data.
