\begin{equation}
\min \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_{i,t} x_{i,t} + \sum_{t=1}^{T-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} s_i y_{i,t}
\end{equation}

where $x_{i,t}$ is the number of units of product $i$ produced in month $t$, and $y_{i,t}$ is the number of units of product $i$ carried over from month $t$ to month $t+1$.
